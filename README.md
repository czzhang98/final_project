# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Related to the COVID-19 Vaccine: A Study of Public Perception

## Abstract: This paper presents a sentiment analysis of tweets related to the COVID-19 vaccine, with a focus on understanding the public perception of the vaccine. Using a pre-existing dataset from Kaggle, we analyzed the sentiment towards the vaccine over a two-year period, from 2020 to 2022. Our analysis revealed that the sentiment towards the vaccine is generally positive, but there is a mix of positive and negative opinions expressed. Furthermore, there is a difference in sentiment between tweets from verified users and general tweets, with verified users having a more positive sentiment towards the vaccine. Addressing misinformation and improving communication strategies are important steps to promote vaccine uptake. Our findings provide valuable insights that can inform future vaccine policy and communication strategies to promote vaccine uptake and prepare for potential future disease outbreaks.
